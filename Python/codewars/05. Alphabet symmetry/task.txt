Consider the word "abode". We can see that the letter a is in position 1 and b is in position 2. In the alphabet, a and b are also in positions 1 and 2. Notice that d and e also occupy the positions they would occupy in the alphabet, which are positions 4 and 5.

Given an array of words, return an array of the number of letters that occupy their positions in the alpahabet for each word. For example, solve(["abode","ABc","xyzD"]) = [4,3,1]. See test cases for more examples.

Input will consist of alphabet characters, both uppercase and lowercase. No spaces.

Good luck!
