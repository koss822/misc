# Prometheus exporter for CNB (Czech National Bank) exchange rates
When called it download exchange rates from CNB and publish them to Prometheus so you can show them in Grafana
or set-up alerts.

Part of the code was generated by ChatGPT but with some modification and debugging, it is definitely not cleanest
code in the world but works fine.

## Dockerizing app
https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/nodejs-docker-webapp

## Installation
Just run 
```
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/cnb-exporter.yml
```

You do not need to compile anything, image is already published. In Prometheus modify configuration to use
**prometheus/scrape-config.yml**
